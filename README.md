# Machine Learning Workflow with Random Forest Classifier

This Python script demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using a Random Forest Classifier. The script includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. It is a useful reference for setting up machine learning pipelines and can be adapted for various classification tasks.

## Code Overview

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Generate histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
   - Check the number of unique elements in each feature.
   - Perform a correlation analysis and create a heatmap to identify correlated features.

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Based on correlation analysis, select relevant features for the model.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle categorical data by label encoding.
   - Remove rows with missing values.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Initialize and train a Random Forest Classifier.
   - Predict on a test set and calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compute the confusion matrix to assess model performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Define a grid of hyperparameters to find the best combination.
   - Use GridSearchCV to search for the best hyperparameters.
   - Print the best hyperparameters found.
